# Use Cases

This directory contains a collection of high-level use cases that demonstrate the capabilities and potential applications of the Serverless Workflow DSL. Each use case provides insights into how to effectively implement workflows in various scenarios, helping newcomers understand the framework's power and flexibility.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of these use cases is to:

- **Educate Newcomers:** Provide clear examples of how to utilize Serverless Workflow DSL for real-world applications.
- **Inspire Innovation:** Showcase the diverse possibilities of workflow automation and orchestration.
- **Facilitate Best Practices:** Encourage consistent structure and documentation, making it easier to share knowledge and experiences within the community.

## Structure

Each use case in this directory MUST follow a specific structure to ensure clarity and consistency. The structure is as follows:

### File Structure

```
./my-cool-use-case      ðŸ‘ˆ The name of the use case. It must be lowercase and contain exclusively alphanumeric characters, except for '-'.
